### Description:
* The Iris Dataset consists of mutiple samples of Iris Flower.
* The Iris flower is categorized into 3 species namely - Setosa, Versicolor & Virginica.<br>
* These species vary in the dimensions of the sepals & petals.

### Objective:
- Import the Iris Dataset from sklearn library.
- Build classification models to predict the species.
- Compare the evaluation metrics of vaious classification algorithms.

### The Project's follows the following steps:
1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Data Manipulation
5. Predictive Modeling
6. Project Outcomes & Conclusions

### Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
The Dataset was quiet small totally just 150 samples & after preprocessing 3.3% of the datasamples were dropped. It was also balanced & didn't require any artificial techniques to balance it.
Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the class seperability.
Feature selection or feature extracting as there were only 4 features, which all contributed towards the right prediction.
Testing multiple algorithms with default hyperparamters gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.
While, Decision Tree Classifier algorithm gave the best overall scores for the current dataset, yet it wise to also consider simpler models as they are more generalisable.
